Modern hypervisors in the PC world include VMware ESX, VMware Player, Xen, Citrix XenServer, Microsoft Hyper-V, VirtualBox, and QEMU. VMWare Player, VirtualBox, and QEMU are application-layer hypervisors (essentially like normal programs), though they rely on some specialized operating system support for virtualization. Linux KVM and FreeBSD's bhyve are kernel modules that effectively convert a normal operating system into a hypervisor.

A common key exchange mechanism in security protocols is the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Common symmetric ciphers are for example:

AES  Advanced Encryption Standard 
3DES
Blowfish

Classical PKC Public Key Cryptographic (PKC) 
public key encryption, digital signatures, and key exchange to enable scalability and usability by removing need for prior key agreement before communications. 

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptosystem for signatures and encryption
Elliptic Curve (ECDH, ECDSA) cryptosystems for key exchange and signatures
Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange


For the Quantum Threat to become real, it would need a sufficiently large QC with number of good noiseless cubits relatively close to double the public key size in bits (n) and the ability to implement a circuit with 64*n^3*lg(n) gates. Such computer is called a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). [3]

Grover’s algorithm - Lev Grover described an algorithm allowing a QC to perform a brute force key search using quadratically fewer steps than would be required classically (Grover’s algorithm)
Shor’s algorithm - Peter Shor showed that QC can efficiently solve integer factorization and and discrete logarithm problems used on existing public key crypto systems, thereby rendering these systems impotent (Shor’s algorithm).



large-scale mathematical factorization algorithms responsible for generating keys are highly vulnerable. Such algorithms — like the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve PKC algorithms — are not considered “quantum-
safe”, even with keys of almost 1,000 decimal digits in length


nce an algorithm becomes vulnerable, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) will flag it
