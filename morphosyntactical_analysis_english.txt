Hello again, my dear ChatGPT. I have a question: Would you be so kind to perform a morpho-syntactical analysis of the following sentence? "I have just been told a moment ago that you were awaiting me in the cafeteria where we first met."
Of course! Here's a morpho-syntactical analysis of the sentence you provided:

"I" is the subject of the sentence, which is a first-person singular pronoun.
"have just been told" is the main verb phrase of the sentence, and it is in the present perfect tense, passive voice, and indicative mood. The auxiliary verb "have" is used to indicate the present perfect tense, while the past participle "been told" is used to form the passive voice.
"a moment ago" is an adverbial phrase that modifies the verb phrase "have just been told." It indicates the time when the action of being told occurred.
"that" is a conjunction that introduces a subordinate clause.
"you" is the subject of the subordinate clause, which is a second-person singular pronoun.
"were awaiting" is the verb phrase of the subordinate clause, which is in the past continuous tense and indicative mood. The past continuous tense is used to indicate an action that was ongoing in the past.
"me" is the object of the verb "awaiting," and it is a first-person singular pronoun.
"in the cafeteria" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverbial modifier of the verb "awaiting." It indicates the location where the action of awaiting occurred.
"where" is a relative pronoun that introduces a relative clause modifying "cafeteria."
"we" is the subject of the relative clause, which is a first-person plural pronoun.
"first met" is the verb phrase of the relative clause, which is in the past simple tense and indicative mood. It describes the time when "we" met for the first time.
Overall, the sentence is a complex sentence that consists of a main clause ("I have just been told") and a subordinate clause ("that you were awaiting me in the cafeteria where we first met"). The subordinate clause provides additional information about the location and time when the speaker was informed about the addressee's waiting.

Are you sure? The subordinate clause "where we first met." is an adjectival relative clause that complements the word "cafeteria" of the main clause. As you pointed out: "in the cafeteria" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverbial modifier of the verb "awaiting." It indicates the location where the action of awaiting occurred. Thus, the subordinate clause provides information about the location but not the time when the speaker was informed about the addressee's waiting. That time is indicated in the main clause: "a moment ago", in the recent past. Also the word "just" in "just been told" points to the recent past. Concerning the subordinate clause, it is a past simple tense that express an action having taken place in a further past. Thus each action ("to await" in the main clause and "to first meet" in the subordinate clause) takes place at a different time. Don't you think so?
You're absolutely right! I apologize for my mistake. The subordinate clause "where we first met" is indeed an adjectival relative clause that modifies the noun "cafeteria." It provides additional information about the specific cafeteria being referred to.

Regarding the time reference, you are also correct. The main clause "I have just been told" indicates that the action of being told occurred in the recent past, while the subordinate clause "you were awaiting me in the cafeteria where we first met" is in the past simple tense, indicating that the action of waiting occurred further in the past. The two actions indeed occur at different times, and the sentence provides information about both.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention and for your insightful analysis!
